# Particle Party
 **Project Overview:**

Particle Party is a physics engine which checks collision between circles and lines. Many of the simulations' variables can be changed using a few sliders while the simulation is running. Some of the editable variables are initial velocity, gravity, and initial particle size. I used Pygame to do rendering while the physics engine was made by me. This project was made as a final project for my computer science class.

**Future Considerations:**

* This system only handles discrete collision (only checking collision at every physics update), meaning that particles moving at high speeds can go through walls. I intend to add a continuous collision system to rectify this issue.
* I would also like to add a system which allows walls to be placed during the simulation.
